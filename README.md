# scorforjavascript
Score Four is a game I loved as a kid.  I've programmed it for the computer multiple times, and this is a JavaScript version.  It is a 2 player board game, that can be found at the link below.

I originally wrote it in Turbo Pascal 6.0 for DOS when I first learned to program.  I then rewrote it as a Java applet years later.  Then I decided to write it as a much simpler JavaScript version in 2011.

When I started looking at the code, I realized it wasn't in too bad of condition, so I just did a minor refactor for readability, and am calling it "good enough".  I plan on writing a mobile version of this, hopefully with 2 players on different devices, so I'm not going to spend any more time on this version.  I might, however, steal some of the logic for determining the winner.
